<h1>More about me</h1>
<p class="p1">As mentioned before, I am currently at a company called Tinroof Software, and working onsite at my first
    client, NCR, working on their Consumer Self Ordering Kiosk. For this project I am using C# and Angular. So far I
    was able to create the groundwork for the QA Automation and I have also established a Jenkins server speeding up
    the build process and allowing our team to have builds instantaneously as compared to before where it might take
    over 3-4 hours to get one build. I also work on fixing high priority bugs for customers work on refactoring
    and optimizing code. I am about halfway through my Post-Bacc program in Computer Science at Oregon State University,
    and I hope to finish this program by June of 2021.

<p class="p2">One of my biggest interests in the computer science field is cybersecurity. In my website I have a couple
    of hidden gems as part of a scavenger hunt. In total there are 3 <span style="color: gold;">hidden</span> gems.
    I have also included features to decrypt hidden messages. If you are able to figure it out please feel
    free to email me using my  <i style="font-weight: bold;color: red">personal</i> email and I can verify your results.
