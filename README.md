# CKWebsite
### This repo is a basic personal website I created using just Javascript, HTML, and CSS for OSU's CS290

This is a basic static site and does not utilize a server. It does make API calls to some basic free API's. You can find the Javascript in the `scripts/` folder, the CSS in the `style/` folder, and the different html files representing the different pages. I added 3 easter eggs to this repo, so if interested, attempt to figure these out without looking at the source code.
